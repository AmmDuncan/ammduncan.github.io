# My portfolio website

Built with Vanilla Js, HTML, CSS/SCSS. [Live site](https://ammielyawson.com).

#### Notable features

- Responsive and interactive
- Micro-animations on button hover
- Variable homepage

#### Why not use a framework?

I wanted to build something great with just the fundamentals.

#### What would I like to add in the future?

A blog. I would like to add a blog built with either Next.js or Gatsby (yet to learn) and share lessons, tips and challenges I encouter.
